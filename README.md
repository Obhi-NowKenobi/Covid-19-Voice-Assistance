# Covid-19-Voice-Assistance
This is a python script in which you can say things like "How many total cases" or "How many cases in the USA", and you will get an audio response quoting the total number of cases/deaths due to the Corona Virus. 
Currently, in order to asks for the death count the phrase is "How many total DEATH" (It's grammatically incorrect, but the google speech recognition does not recognize when I say "deaths"). 
The rest of the project works fine.
